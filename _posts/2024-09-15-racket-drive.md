This September, WeServe launched a racket drive aimed at giving back to the local tennis community and making the sport more accessible to everyone. Over the past month, we’ve collected around 15 rackets, each donated by generous community members who share our passion for both tennis and service. These rackets are donated to IPlayTennis, where they are skillfully refurbished and sold back to the community at affordable prices. 

The proceeds from these refurbished racket sales go directly to AYTEF (Atlanta Youth Tennis & Education Foundation). This  organization uses the funds to continue offering free tennis lessons, hosting block parties that foster community connection, and providing tutoring for students. Through this drive, we aim to support not only tennis players but also to create educational and social opportunities for youth in the area.

By participating in this drive, whether donating a racket or spreading the word, our community is helping to sustain AYTEF’s mission of providing free, inclusive tennis programs that go beyond the sport itself. From giving kids a chance to experience tennis to offering them academic support and mentorship, AYTEF does so much for underprivileged youth—and we're proud to play a small role in that.

We are incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support we've received during this racket drive, and we hope to continue partnering with local organizations like IPlayTennis and AYTEF to make a lasting difference. Together, we’re serving up more than tennis—we’re serving up opportunities, connections, and a brighter future for everyone involved.
