This past Friday, WeServe had the privilege of coaching and volunteering at AYTEF’s (Atlanta Youth Tennis & Education Foundation) monthly block party, and what an amazing experience it was! These events are designed to introduce kids from under-resourced areas in the Atlanta community to the game of tennis through fun, engaging lessons and exciting activities. With volunteers from Peachtree Ridge High School, we were able to make a meaningful contribution by helping out with on-court coaching for K-5th graders, organizing the party logistics, and, of course, serving pizza to the kids and their families.

These monthly events specifically target children from neighborhoods in Atlanta that suffer from low graduation rates and poor funding.. The block parties offer an inclusive and energetic environment, making sure that every child who attends feels welcomed and excited about learning something new.

What makes these block parties truly special is that they are completely free for both the children and their families. Everything from the coaching to the tennis equipment is provided at no cost, thanks to generous donations from the community and organizations like AYTEF. The families don’t have to worry about bringing anything—everything, including food, is taken care of. It’s a way to give these kids an experience that not only fosters physical activity but also encourages teamwork, confidence, and the joy of learning new skills.

WeServe was thrilled to contribute to such an impactful event. Watching the kids' faces light up as they learned how to hold a racket or hit their first forehand was incredibly rewarding. For many of the younger children, this was their very first time stepping onto a tennis court, and our volunteers were there to guide and encourage them every step of the way. In addition to the on-court coaching, our team helped ensure that the event ran smoothly by organizing activities, setting up stations, and, of course, managing the all-important pizza station!

These block parties are more than just a day of fun—they’re an opportunity for these kids to be part of something bigger. They provide an engaging, resourceful outlet that combines sport with community, encouraging children to step outside their comfort zones and try something new. Through these events, AYTEF hopes to inspire not only a love for tennis but also a sense of belonging and the importance of education and personal growth.

WeServe is grateful for the opportunity to work with AYTEF and contribute to their mission of making tennis and education accessible to underprivileged youth in Atlanta. We look forward to many more block parties in the future and to continuing to serve the kids and families who attend these incredible events!
