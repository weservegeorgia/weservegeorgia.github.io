WeServe had an amazing time this past Friday coaching and volunteering at AYTEF's monthly block party! These events are meant to introduce kids in the Atlanta area to tennis through lessons and fun activities. With volunteers from Peachtree Ridge High School, we were able to help out with on-court coaching of K-5th graders, organize the party, and of course, help with the pizza!

AYTEF's block parties help target under-resourced kids in the Atlanta community, specifically areas with low graduation rates and poor funding. These parties, held monthly, are a way to introduce kids to tennis and fun extracurrcilar activities in an engaging and resourceful way. Block parties are completely free for kids and their families, with coaching, equipment, and food all donated and given for free.
