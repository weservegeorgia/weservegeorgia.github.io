## In collaboration with AYTEF and other organizations, WeServe strives to provide volunteer opportunities to local highschool students to serve the youth in the Atlanta area through tennis and education. With a particular emphasis on minority communities and low-income families, we reduce participation barriers by helping organizations that offer programs either for free or at a low cost. Our focus is placed in neighborhoods experiencing increased need, with a significant portion of residents facing low graduation rates and financial instability.
