In collaboration with [AYTEF](https://www.aytef.org/) and other organizations, WeServe strives to provide volunteer opportunities to local high school students to serve the youth in the Atlanta area through tennis and education. With a particular emphasis on minority communities and low-income families, we reduce participation barriers by helping organizations that offer programs either for free or at a low cost. Our focus is placed in neighborhoods experiencing increased need, with a significant portion of residents facing low graduation rates and financial instability.

The special thing about WeServe is that participants can volunteer with or without prior tennis experience. The various programs and volunteer opportunties WeServe provides extends beyond the tennis court, with participation in fundraising drives, tutoring with a focus on STEM, and helping organizations run their events smoothly. Volunteering events can be registered through the "Volunteer" page of our website, and information about these events can be seen on our "Prorgrams" post.
