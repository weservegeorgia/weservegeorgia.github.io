WeServe is a club located in the Atlanta area that helps funnel volunteers into tennis related nonprofit organizations in need of assistance.

Organizations we work with such as AYTEF are in need of high school volunteers in order for their programs to succeed. These programs have profound impacts on the underprivileged youth of Atlanta as they provide resources and opportunities in the field of education and tennis. 

Block Parties offered by AYTEF are one of the biggest volunteering events that WeServe will provide. Block parties thrown by AYTEF occur on the last Friday of every month, where volunteers help coach kids K-12, help provide food, help set up, and make sure activities run smoothly. Volunteers do not require tennis knowledge in order to participate. Registration can be signed up through WeServe. Visit the “Volunteer” page on our website to register for open spots now.

WeServe will also hold used racket and tennis ball drives that will be donated to AYTEF and other partner organizations. This allows kids in the local community interested in tennis to start with no cost. Racket drives will be held through I PLAY TENNIS’s racket collection drive, in which they collect, refurbish, and offer used tennis rackets for the under-resourced youth in Atlanta.

All volunteer opportunities WeServe provides will be linked and provided through our “Volunteer” page, where WeServe members can sign-up and participate in the aid of the local community.
