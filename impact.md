WeServe is a Gwinnett County club that helps funnel volunteers into tennis related nonprofit organizations in need of volunteers. Organizations such as AYTEF and ACEing Autism have profound impacts on the underpriviliged and underrepresented youth of the Atlanta Area. They provide resources and opportunities in tennis that reaches the youth far beyond just the sport. 

Through AYTEF, the various programs WeServe participates with include becoming a tennis volunteer at the Fair Oaks Tennis Center, being an academic volunteer for K-7 assisting with homework and academic enrinchement, volunteering at local block parties, and participating in used racket drives. As a nonprofit, all these activities that AYTEF offers is in need of volunteering and participation in order to persist in the assistance of the local community in the Atlanta area.

Block Parties offered by AYTEF are one of the biggest volunteering events that WeServe will provide. Block parties thrown by AYTEF occur on the last Friday of every month, where volunteers help coach kids K-12, help with providing food, help set up the party, and make sure the activites run smoothly throughout the day. Many volunteers are needed, whether you have tennis experience or not, and registration can be signed up through WeServe. Visit the “Volunteer” page on our website to register for open spots now.

WeServe will also hold used racket and tennis ball drives that will be donated to AYTEF and other partner organizations. This allows kids in the local community interested in tennis to start with no cost. Racket drives will be held through I PLAY TENNIS’s local used racket collection drive, in which they collect, refurbish, and offer used tennis rackets for the under-resourced youth.

All programs above will be linked and provided through our “Volunteer” page, where WeServe members can sign-up and participate in the aid of the local community.
